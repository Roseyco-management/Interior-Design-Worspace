Hey Arnis, what would the process look like for using an AI to sort all incoming emails into respective folders, send a notification if an email would be deemed important, and mock up a potential response for review? I know that would be a pretty complicated email tool to build. I wouldn't classify that as being a part of any of the automation packages that Allan planned out. 

Is something like that possible? I assume it's high complexity, what would be an ideal price range for setup and monthly?

T Charrier, [Nov 11, 2025 at 13:03]
You think this can be done?

Arnis, [Nov 11, 2025 at 14:09]
I need to look into this a little more and I have a few questions

Arnis, [Nov 11, 2025 at 14:10]
Is he using gmail or something else?

T Charrier, [Nov 11, 2025 at 14:10]
Yeah, Gmail I believe. Sitting a meeting in an hour

Arnis, [Nov 11, 2025 at 14:11]
Also, gmail kind of does this already especially with google workspace so how custom does he want to make the folders for sorting and responses?

T Charrier, [Nov 11, 2025 at 14:11]
Want to provide a few questions for me to ask the client? 

We may just set up the organization for them and then use the AI to draft a response?

T Charrier, [Nov 11, 2025 at 14:12]
If Gmail already has methods to sort the emails

Arnis, [Nov 11, 2025 at 14:16]
So it looks like a lot of these already exist would any of these be the solution he’s look for or does it need to be more custom

Arnis, [Nov 11, 2025 at 14:17]
Because it depends on his budget

Arnis, [Nov 11, 2025 at 14:17]
If he’s looking for something general we can set the apps I sent you up for him

Arnis, [Nov 11, 2025 at 14:19]
If it’s something a little more custom to his workflow I wouldn’t say it’s difficult but it would take time to set it all up for him

Arnis, [Nov 11, 2025 at 14:21]
And if he wanted to take it to the next level like we train the ai to respond in his style and tone  and it’s constantly learning about him and his business like it search through old emails to make his responses then that would be a lot more difficult

T Charrier, [Nov 11, 2025 at 14:24]
Okay, I'll see what they want to do. I'll get a gauge of their budget and sell which program would work best. Any idea on some good up sells that would go good in tandem with this service?

I assume we'd charge the setup fee and then slightly over the subscriptions cost monthly for us to maintain the system for them?

Arnis, [Nov 11, 2025 at 14:27]
Yeah I’d say get familiar with those apps and find out if they solve his problems or if he needs something a little more custom

Arnis, [Nov 11, 2025 at 14:28]
Yeah set up fee and a retainer of $100 maybe for maintenance

Arnis, [Nov 11, 2025 at 14:28]
What kinda business does he have?

T Charrier, [Nov 11, 2025 at 14:31]
Interior designer

Arnis, [Nov 11, 2025 at 14:45]
It really depends on their workflow and what they currently do. There are definitely a few things that we can offer, but I'm just not entirely sure of what they have, what their pain points are, and what they currently do.

Maybe you need to do a little bit more discovery on that call to find their pain points and see if there are any repetitive tasks that we can automate. 

For example, do they use social media? We could do organic social media, or we could set them up with an AI-powered social media scheduling and automation tool. We could use an existing tool, and I actually am planning on building a custom one for ourselves, but that will obviously take a few weeks to do.

What about paid marketing are they doing anything for that currently? 

What about client onboarding? What do they do? How do they onboard clients? If it's a simple workflow that's more or less the same for each new client, could we automate an email sequence with welcome emails, design process introductions, and project milestone updates? Possibly.

Do they have a website gallery for their portfolio, for example? What's their current website like? Could they improve their website? We could set up automated lead capture. We could find them leads, set up an automated email outreach, or we could set them up with a CRM integration. Whether it's with HubSpot, or we build them a custom one, just like a custom built CRM, similar to yours, but less advanced because it would just be a CRM.

Or maybe they would want a full-fledged custom workspace for themselves. Or we could just keep it simple. Maybe we could just set up Google Workspace for them with advanced email, calendar automations with Google Calendar, Google Drive automations. That's all for project management, file sharing, and appointment scheduling.

So it really just depends. Just find their pain points, see what we can offer them, just to make running their business easier and smoother.

T Charrier, [Nov 11, 2025 at 14:45]
Likely, these will work. We can do the setup and a small maintenance fee if she has any problems. I'll be speaking with her to see about any other AI solutions that her business may need and upsell for some packages

T Charrier, [Nov 12, 2025 at 02:56]
So during my meeting today, we discussed what her client oboarding process looked like (It's completely fucked, bouncing between 3 different CRMs and a few other programs like Canva). We ended up discussing what it would look like to simplify this process and automate as much as possible. I've put together this proposal for a custom CRM. Please review this proposal and let me know if there is anything that we need to change before I send it to the client. I tried to be as descriptive as possible so that the dev team and client can have a thorough understanding of the complete scope of the project.

Ps- The proposal is completely hand written and based on the conversation that was had w/ the client. It's no AI generated slop
