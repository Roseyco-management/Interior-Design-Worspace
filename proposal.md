CRM
The CRM would be designed specifically with how your business operates on a day to day basis in mind. This will be the central hub for daily operations and project management. The CRM will automate many important tasks that need to be done regularly and keep things organized and never allow anything to slip through the cracks given that reminders come automatically. The system will be built to reduce the complexity of online operations and forced simplification by consolidation of all of your favorite aspects of the 4-6 different pieces of software that you’re bouncing between. 
Pros
Simplification of tech stack
All in 1 hub for daily operations
Guaranteed connection between the software that is left in your tech stack
Automations set up for you by the professionals
Program can be modified at a later date as your company changes and grows
Cons
Larger upfront costs for development from scratch
Will take time to implement (4-8 weeks)
Takes time to flush out issues with new custom software (Support will be provided to ensure smooth transition)
Dashboards
Clients- A dashboard full of all current and past clients. Will contain all personal information and their history of patronage to your business. Will be the information that is pulled from when sending out marketing promos, invoices, and specific paperwork.
Contractors- A full list of all subcontractors with sub-sets for Plumber, Electrician, etc. and a quick search feature. Will contain all information such as jobs done in past for you, what they’re currently working on, and other pertinent information.
Projects- Templates for average checklists for kitchens, bathrooms, etc for quick project build time. Ability to assign specific subcontractors to projects and tied to specific customer accounts. Will be able to link to Canva for the conceptualization and Houz for material ordering/approvals. 
Sales Pipeline- This will show all inbound leads whether they’ve processed a forum submission through the website, reached out to you through FB/IG and booked an appointment, or manually entered as a referral or at an in-person event such as a home show. Manage where the prospect is in the funnel, having processes to automate them through the sales funnel such as sending proposals or an initial contact email to your follow up job description forum. Once jobs have been marked as “won” or “lost” they’ll be filed in the general clients dashboard with all pertinent information related to the job for recall or further progression to the project. 
Calendar- Will be a dashboard that is showing relevant scheduled events from delivery of materials for a job, when jobs are scheduled to start and end, new client discovery meetings, and more. This can be synced up to Gmail and IOS calendars respectively.
Passwords manager- A single secure hub to store all passwords for external programs and users. 
Total Software Link Hub- A single dashboard with links to all of your most used services such as Canva, Houz, Gmail and more to make online direct navigation easier and reduce clutter in browsers. 
Account Management Center- A dashboard to manage subcontractor, client, and other employee access to any information that you would deem necessary.
To Do List?- You had discussed having the possibility to have a daily checklist and the benefits of it. I’d recommend having an option for you to use one in the program and could put together a way to make a to-do list based on the daily schedule in the calendar dashboard. Something to think about but could be done.
Financial Reporting Hub (Job Profitability Breakdown)?- We could create a dashboard for your financial reporting for things such as job profitability, average job value, revenue tracking. This can be as surface level or in-depth as you want. I would like to work with you to make all of the most important information regarding the finances visualized.
Automations
Lead Capture / Client Onboarding - (Website forum submission - Email sequence - Appointment booked in calendar - Appointment reminders)
Gmail Calendar Sync - (Between 3 platforms)
Proposal / Project Approval - (Materials picked out - Send link to client for approval or changes - Follow up sequence to ensure client makes choices in a timely manner) and/or  (Scope of project is defined - preliminary estimate document generated based on average range costs for services marked in project checklist - Sent to client along with contract to get job started)
Client notification of Project Updates - (When important tasks are marked as completed throughout the project dashboard text or email notifications can be sent to regularly inform the customer of where the job is at and create a consistent experience for customer satisfaction during the remodeling process)
Project Dashboard Sync with Canva Project Design - (Once projects are created in the CRM and clients are signed it would trigger an automation to generate a folder in Canva with all pertinent customer and job details. Further project conceptualization would be completed in Canva)
Project Updates on Material Orders -  (Would tie in with #4 except for the delivery of materials to a client’s home / the job site.)
Invoicing - (Products marked ordered - Invoice generated - Send to client for payment)  (Project marked completed - invoice with full job summary and remaining balance due generated - Send to customer for final payment) or any variation thereof. Would need to speak more on what your payment process looks like to figure out when invoices would need to be made and sent.
Appointment Reminders - (For all facets of business whether it’s to remind a contractor that the materials for their part of the job are scheduled to be delivered, a new client consultation reminder sequence, or updates on when the inspections of the jobs are supposed to be. Any of the important reminders can always be automated as needed)
Cost
Initial build- 5,500$ (Can be paid in full or accept a deposit of 25% and monthly installments of remaining 75%, whichever is easier for you)
Monthly hosting, maintenance, and upgrades (Within reason)- Ballparking 400$ (This may fluctuate based on the token usage / subscription requirements to automation platforms) This will take a few months of usage to determine appropriate fee as current usage of the automations is unknown.
