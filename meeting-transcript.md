Speaker 1 (00:02)
And then I've got these all labeled as to like, well, for this job, we only have one bathroom, but different materials. I can see like what's.

selection wise what she needs to choose and approve. So on this one, I can see there's 4,000 approved so far. So I can keep a budget tracker on it. Well, that we're looking at, she can approve or decline. She can send a question here or I can come back to her on this part here too. ⁓ But I also, create this library. So I go through and I create all of these materials for them.

And then I add in all the information for it too, as far as like dimensions of it, color, finish, you know, that kind of thing. So I'm, I'm inputting all this info and then that's going to be in my items library. So if I have it. Particularly to this, this client in their bathroom, or if I have it just in my library itself, then I'll have a whole library of all these materials I can pull from that I've done for.

So that's one thing I didn't know if that this would encompass that as well.

Speaker 3 (01:22)
Do

you use a lot of the same suppliers usually or ⁓ do you have a lot of the same vendors for your remodel material?

Speaker 1 (01:35)
I do and like I have my go-to's for like my bedding. I'll have my go-to for my bedding line. I'll have my go-to if I'm doing that. But my bread and butter's in the kitchen and bathroom. like for plumbing supplies, I have my go-to's. Supplier for those. ⁓ And then I'll have other ones that I have accounts with. So yeah.

Speaker 3 (02:00)
Okay. currently what we had discussed in the project proposal I initially sent, ⁓ did not have this, but I was, you know, in the process talking with my, ⁓ lead tech guy. He said that we can use AI to scrape the websites of your favorite vendors and then just have a catalog of all of their products. And you would be able to type in, you know, Hey, we want

three possible backsplashes that fit this budget and this color. And then it'll use AI to scrape those websites and then suggest, you know, the top three products that would fit that description. It is possible, but not something that we had ⁓ initially discussed, but this is definitely something that we can do and consolidate.

Speaker 1 (02:53)
So like if I go into my company vendors list here, I mean, these are like all my vendors.

Speaker 3 (03:07)
Mm-hmm.

Speaker 1 (03:09)
So I have wholesale and trade accounts set up. And then this goes, you know, A to Z. So there's a lot. ⁓

Speaker 3 (03:17)
Yeah.

Speaker 2 (03:20)
You can export it so it's can actually export it for us so it's fine. ⁓ And then subcontractors and even all the items you have there you should be able to export that and that's a plug and play for us.

Speaker 1 (03:38)
want and then said contenders have to set up teams have to set up but from so from this point if I go back into this is I can take to the third one here but it's going to have more info ⁓

So once they, this is the old system. Here's one in the new system. So this one is finished. This was just the bathroom, sent over the materials from this point in shader selections board. We did the approval and moved them over to proposals. I could be repeating myself, but I'm just gonna go through it. ⁓ So from the proposal here, then from...

She'll approve. I move it over to the invoice. That'll link.

says it's linked. So I didn't have to open it up to go into it from this point. But then you'll have the invoice and then I'll see here that this one, I know she's passed you. She's gonna be passed you here soon. I know she hasn't paid yet on this. But from there, I'll have the invoices, all the materials. I'll be able to push them from that.

Speaker 3 (04:59)
Mm-hmm.

Speaker 1 (05:06)
invoice if it's materials onto a purchase order and it'll just create purchase orders and then I can go in and I can order things from this point and track everything and then I put it onto the calendar usually here as to when things would be coming in. So that's like a new thing they had added was ⁓ time of arrival or estimated dates or something. But that kind of gives us this overall.

kind of like walk free from that, from proposal, procurement, ⁓ payment and purchase orders.

Speaker 3 (05:47)
And

then how does this program connect at all with your CRM on HoneyBook? No, so you're manually having to go back and forth between managing your leads and then getting them put into this piece? Okay. Right. And then ⁓ are you still using Basecamp at all? I know that was another CRM that you were...

Speaker 1 (05:54)
No.

playing with. Yeah, ⁓ but I've been thinking about like, I know it's what I love about this and it's just so easy. So it has been nice to use with subs. Like with my husband, I'll just put him on here, the face camp and

going to some of those, but yeah, so with base camp owl.

⁓ So at Basecamp, I'll go to basically be like my client, communication, and then my subcontractor coordination is what I've been using it as more so and then I have my to do list on there. Now with this system, it also does do project chat. So I could chat with a team member and keep the notes here. I can do notes, which I think the client would see if I have any notes going on.

here but you know this is my note to myself but I think she sees this note so that's where I'm like ⁓ probably shouldn't have put that here did not realize so ⁓

Speaker 3 (07:33)
Okay.

Speaker 1 (07:39)
not certain, I think she does. But it's already been there since July, so this isn't true. But anyhow, but I can do the notes here. I can do phone calls. If we had phone calls, create a call log of things like just have messages of what's happening, what's been going on. As far as like, it's just me doing it, then I usually try to, you know, I feel like I don't have to relay all the things on here if it's something that

It's just me, but if I have a team of people, then I can have a team of people record things going on here and then we could all be on the same page. But with Basecamp, that's what Basecamp I've been using for is having like that task to do list of things just to keep track of what's going on with it. Okay. And then with my schedule of

of subs I keep on base camp and then with my materials coming in I keep on how.

And then. But it keeps them separated. So then I know like if it's on base camp, I know that's going to be like an install. Basically, if it's on house, then I know that that's going to be an item that's coming in.

things I need to do. But ideally then I would be able to, if I had another team member, give that to somebody else where they can manage. But yeah, I, the answer is I still use Basecamp, but I'm uncertain if I'm going to move everything over into house. That was my thoughts was just to move everything over and stop trying to use so many different platforms.

⁓ okay. I'll show you too with this particular program. Also, what they started to do was put the mood boards in here too. So I played around with some of them new boards here. Cause I've been using Canva. Canva is just so easy. ⁓ here I have to upload, download. I can't just copy paste, you know, but once I put it in to a job, then I can go in and actually like click on it to bring it in.

to the project to move forward. And then it's already here and I could just hide it, unhide it. And so it would be seen by my client. So that part makes that easier. Where I can just hide unhide and have it visible to the client. As opposed to having Canva where, mean, Canva, would still have to download, upload, and then I have to make sure that I save it as a JPEG. Otherwise I put links on there for a...

my reference but otherwise it'll have links attached if I save it.

Speaker 3 (11:07)
Okay.

All righty. And does having all of the projects visualized out here like this usually help with the visualization process for your client?

Speaker 1 (11:24)
this.

Speaker 3 (11:26)
Yeah, just kind of how you got the mirrors and what lights and stuff are on there or do you do anything with like generating a complete product image.

Speaker 1 (11:36)
Yeah, yeah, like having ⁓

See soon, I think.

Speaker 3 (12:04)
What are your thoughts on the difference of the sound?

Speaker 2 (12:09)
What do mean? Compared to RCR?

Speaker 3 (12:13)
Yeah, I mean, this seems pretty in depth.

Speaker 2 (12:17)
quite bespoke so

no it's it's it's all doable like it's just a matter of priority Angie are you willing to like go and migrate over a whole software again so that everything is in one place that would be the main thing I would say

Speaker 1 (12:36)
Well, the main question is if all of these things can be implemented and I didn't know how that would be where, like even with materials, but I need to go into a different system to be able to pull in all those materials like the library. ⁓

Speaker 3 (12:54)
Well, we would just export your current library and use that as reference point in our system. So you'd still have all of the same library and all the same product and information in there. It would just be all collated in one place.

Speaker 2 (13:10)
We just have to export it, that's all. And then we can connect it with Canva as well.

Speaker 1 (13:40)
So.

Okay. So like with this one, you asked if I had other plans and just showing like, yeah, I downloaded, uploaded, these are preliminary, you know, and then ideally that then I put it into their or they're putting that file so they could actually comment back on here. But I did add it into my house as a file so they can comment. ⁓

But.

So with that, like you're saying, like with your system, you would have a link to go to Canva. So I would still have Canva here. I would still be using Canva, I'd still be uploading, downloading it into the system, right?

Speaker 3 (14:28)
And then we would also have automation set up. So every time you create a new project, an automation will trigger to have all of the client's details and what the project is about. And it'll automatically create a new Canva project for you to do. So you don't have to through all the projects set up every single time as well.

Speaker 1 (14:53)
I what I just call a template and then so I'll just go in and. Perfect.

Speaker 3 (15:02)
If you've already got a template, then we'll use the automation just to, you know, create that template for you and then you'll be able to go in there and do all your manual adjustments.

Speaker 1 (15:18)
I guess I'm just, there's a lot. And so I'm just curious as to with everything, like Canva would be linked to it. HoneyBook, wouldn't have to use anymore because it would be, you'd have your own system for it basically.

Speaker 3 (15:40)
Essentially we would be cutting a house, honey book, and

Speaker 1 (15:48)
⁓ what's the other one? ⁓

Speaker 2 (15:53)
is.

Speaker 3 (15:54)
Facecam,

yeah. We would just be consolidating all of those three platforms and all of your favorite aspects of them into one program. And then you'll still use Canva for your project creation.

Speaker 1 (16:12)
So, okay. ⁓ If I'm adding another item, how do I add another item into your system?

Speaker 2 (16:23)
We through the same process so we'll actually. Bollocks. We would just replicate the exact same process that you just use for honey. And even if we have to we can just simplify.

Speaker 3 (16:25)
You did that one.

Speaker 1 (16:39)
If I might, let me just go to.

not that I would want that.

on here.

And I want to put like a sink in here.

Speaker 3 (17:09)
I think we're still looking at your camera on the screen.

Speaker 1 (17:16)
So if I'm wanting to put this in, I've got a clipper tool up here at the top. You see my little mouth now?

I have a little icon at the top that I found that's like, I think it was like.

Speaker 2 (17:35)
Is that an extension?

Speaker 3 (17:37)
and start

now.

Speaker 1 (17:39)
but this will do an auto, could do auto fill AI and it'll bring in all the information and then I can update that information, which this is a new feature they started doing. So I usually click on that. Sometimes it catches things, sometimes don't. So I have to review it anyway, but otherwise then I can go through and choose what pictures I want to have clicked on it. Then I can change my name here. I can put if it has a markup to it or not. ⁓ This is how I enter.

things into my library and then I'll update this is nobody's gonna read all this. So that's not necessary. I'll put in the only things that really need to be necessary for this. like, yeah.

Speaker 3 (18:23)
Okay, yeah that kind of goes back to our initial setup with it and exporting all of the information on your vendors. Essentially we're going to be pulling all of their products and having regular ⁓ have AI do regular searches through their website for any new products to add to an internal database of all of your available products.

So you wouldn't have to go through this process of clipping because it would all be on an internal database already Does that sound about right Alan?

Speaker 1 (18:58)
like a lot though.

Speaker 2 (19:00)
It be done, but I think this is much more simpler, giving you that tool. So we can create this tool as well.

Okay. It does seem because it's more specific and the prices might change, right?

Speaker 1 (19:15)
Yeah, that's the other thing is like, okay, this price, I haven't logged in yet either, but this price is gonna be different than, well, yeah. And then also if there's, at the end of the year, certain lines will go up like 5 % cost.

Speaker 2 (19:22)
wholesale.

So it has to be quite adaptive. How do you do it?

Speaker 1 (19:37)
If I have it clipped, then it's not going to do that. But if it's doing what you're saying, Thomas, I think the net road update cost would.

Speaker 2 (19:46)
Yeah.

Speaker 1 (19:49)
That seems like it's a lot. I you tell me, because I'm just, it's not my job, but I mean, I feel like going through and putting all these, all from this, Ferguson and everything that's going to be from like Barclay products in and everything from like the whole list of vendors that I have, that seems to be.

Speaker 2 (20:10)
it's actually quite easy. So we have a scraper that can scrape anything online. It's crazy now what you can do with AI. So he'll just have another screen where it just scrapes it on its own. So it's it'll just do its own thing. But it's just trying to get the useful information that you want, which is all those categories ⁓ and then the price fluctuations as well. Because do you go in there and manually do it at the moment?

Speaker 1 (20:33)
Having

ripple cost is always nice because then I'm not having to take the time for me just to go back in and double check that everything is correct, you know, but it's part of it. guess it's what I'm used to Yeah, I may only do it on my previous when I was wholesale kitchen and bathroom. I worked at the manage the store before it was they automatically updated all the prices.

Speaker 2 (20:48)
so you manually do it. Okay.

Speaker 1 (21:02)
It would be really helpful and save a lot of time if it was updated and I wasn't having to go back in and and do it all the time From this point also just to share a few other things like this lead is stupid the same They come from house pro only

Speaker 2 (21:11)
Yeah.

Sorry, we don't see it.

⁓ it's still on the other screen.

Speaker 1 (21:29)
Okay, well.

and it's just something that house does. So my, my honey book is actually the one that goes to my website, but they have this lead from their, their house pro website. But these are never, they're never anything that's good. You know, just saying. Okay. It's usually, I don't know what you call them, like just on a wild goose chase. It's not a real.

Speaker 3 (22:05)
Yeah, just somebody playing around with the house website probably.

Speaker 2 (22:08)
So you have two websites linked and I'm guessing...

Speaker 1 (22:11)
Yeah, I have one on house because I had one before they Took over our system. Okay, and so then house decided they were gonna take over the system that I which is what it was before And start doing it on I don't how you explain it, but having that I always call it CRM, but having their own platform for all of this

But before you had like, I put my name and information on the house, if people were searching me, then they could find me on how that's a designer. So I had it listed there. I I have my website is linked to like our home show, a home builder association. I have my own personal website that shares my projects. And I'm not, you that's the one that I'm, I would maintain. I'm not maintaining the one on the house. Okay. But.

From this, what I wanted to share again was a things.

This is where I can't see right now. But I had a couple of I'm sorry. I feel very sad.

Sales tax currently, I have to go in and I did that last week, making sure that all the tax thing was recorded correctly. I have to be the one that enters all of it. This would be a huge benefit if I wouldn't have to be doing this all the time. But with every vendor that I set up, have to put in for one if they're paying tax or if I'm paying tax. So if I'm tax exempt or if they, know, and then I have to set up. ⁓

like if it's coming from, if you're the vendor. So like for instance, Alan, you're an Ireland. So your sales tax rate, if I'm not tax exempt, I'd be paying your tax rate. So that I would be putting into here. If I'm putting a markup on that, then I would have the Missouri tax rate going to the client for just, yeah.

And then, and then this would report the tax that I paid to you and it would report the tax that I paid or the client paid. So then I can send it to the IRS, but it doesn't, this doesn't work very well. this is, regardless if that ever worked out, it would be great. But I had, I had another whole thought and I'm sorry, I've lost you on the tolls for the clipping. ⁓

And then.

I don't know what else they have on here. links to Google Drive, but I use Dropbox because my drafting system will not say it's just Google Drive.

Speaker 2 (25:19)
Angie, what would you say is the most time-consuming part? it's taxes, right? And then the actual manual listings. So it's like you have to go there and change the price, right? Those are your two sticklers.

Speaker 1 (25:32)
I don't know.

don't know if like changing the price of all the materials is really a big support because I'm reviewing all the materials anyway. as I'm reviewing it, then I look at it, but.

⁓ It could be.

Contracts, feel like. Actually, so with my honey book, I have my contract there and then I have it automated with proposal. make a proposal.

Speaker 2 (25:57)
Okay.

Speaker 1 (26:12)
for each project, I'll have a proposal. Like if you're doing a bathroom, like, okay, we're gonna cover. ⁓ And then on my base camp, have that set up with my, I have a checklist. So I'll have, like if we're gonna do bathroom, then we'll have a vanity, faucet, sink, you know, but maybe you don't wanna have, you know, light fixtures or something, you know? So I'll click off everything we do. ⁓

And then I'll be like, here's my estimate of proposal time and a contract. And then having that automated is just really helpful. ⁓

Speaker 2 (26:49)
So that is all made at the moment.

Speaker 1 (26:52)
So for the most time consuming is that from that point, then moving them into this system and then having, I don't know what's all.

probably the contracts would be most time consuming and then the products, checking the cost of everything and making sure everything is in good details. probably those two.

Speaker 2 (27:21)
Because the reason why I'm asking that is because there's a lot there to overhaul right and then also brand might not be your priority it might just be the time saving and then automating those processes that we just spoke about those five and then maybe have a think about those and more in depth and then we'll understand it a bit more because I feel like because Thomas told me I think it's honey like how much do you pay for all these subscriptions?

Speaker 1 (27:50)
Honey book is $30 a month. Face camp is $30 a month. And it adds per user, but right now I just have two users on it. So it's 15 per user. And the issue with

Speaker 2 (27:53)
Yeah, so.

Speaker 1 (28:13)
like with house, it's just with contractors in general, they don't want to log in. So I tried to do this with base camp where I created all these files, which is the same thing I have on my drop box. I put them all into base camp and then they can't. No.

Speaker 2 (28:30)
Is that automated?

See, those are the things I think it would be better for you. don't think, because developing this from scratch, it would cost a bit. It wouldn't be 15 bucks per month, that kind of thing. Like we're talking a complete software make, right? I think automating these processes would be a completely ⁓ better for you.

because again, it seems to be your time that sucked into that. We don't need to recreate this if we don't need to, but we can smooth it out. So those manual processes that you're going through, we can actually fix. We've done it with taxes before. So we've done it for a Dutch company and they had big invoicing problems. We automated the entire process. And then likewise, even Dropbox 2.

⁓ house wasn't it yeah or base sorry base you can do that too you can automate that process too and then the listing process we can double verify for you that can be a process that we could do so these are i think will be the the changers it wouldn't be the software

Speaker 1 (29:41)
Bye.

Speaker 2 (29:42)
because it would require too much investment, I would say, from your part. Like I think you're, yeah, you're paying 15 bucks for this kind of stuff, but for the automations, that's where you're losing all your time.

Speaker 1 (29:53)
Yeah, and then I have with how's like right now I'm grandfathered in ⁓ with what I was paying with the previous system that it's going to go up a lot whenever it I thought my my period time is over so they gave me another year where I can try to implement everything was still transitioning through this year my old system to the new.

Speaker 2 (29:55)
That'll be easier.

Speaker 1 (30:21)
I've looked into other platforms, so Houzz is just one of them, but there's like materials, new one, program is a new one.

Speaker 2 (30:32)
how much are they though? much is the new pricing going to cost you?

Speaker 1 (30:36)
So going, if I went into, just depends. Material is based on.

five projects at a time.

Speaker 2 (30:49)
Have you done like a cost analysis on them?

Speaker 1 (30:52)
I've done, I I've just sampled each of them, but they all have things that I would have to implement something from somewhere else regardless. They don't have everything, which that's fine. So here's where if you have...

They were doing it per project. The idea, 115 per month.

Speaker 2 (31:21)
How many projects do you go through a month?

Speaker 1 (31:25)
my projects in my world currently.

average.

Speaker 2 (31:31)
on

on average.

Speaker 1 (31:35)
What I should do? ⁓

Currently, I know as of today, I was working on three different projects today. I've got four.

Speaker 3 (31:47)
And that's in one day. So we're extrapolating that out. we doing like 10 or 15 a month or?

Speaker 1 (31:49)
Yeah.

Speaker 2 (31:50)
Okay.

Speaker 1 (31:56)
have but I wouldn't recommend it. It's crazy.

We finished up three projects right before Thanksgiving. And so that was nice. Got two of them that were done before Christmas. So that's been helpful. there was like, that's five. And then I had four of them that I was working on today. So there was nine.

I would say like nine or 10 that I had been working on. And yeah, so don't work them in that. But some of them are all different phases to I do the project management also Alan. So that's one thing is like I do the interior design. So I meet with the client. I get all the jobs. I set up the contractors. I get their quotes. I do all the ordering.

Speaker 3 (32:30)
within the last 30 days.

Speaker 1 (32:52)
the sourcing of the materials, the layout, the plans, ⁓ and then the delivery between me my husband. And then my husband has a lot of the manual labor, but I also like, we hire out electricians that we work with, plumbers that we work with, you know, so, but I am always setting up new accounts too. So, you know, I can always, if I can get materials at wholesale, then I'm going to do that. ⁓

But then I also help with project management. So there's just making sure that everything's getting done, checking back in like two jobs that need to get done. They have thresholds that are missing on the job. I know it's too much information for you, but like those are those little pieces. I'm like, as soon as those come in, we'll get them off the list. But I have to follow through and make sure that they're following through because they'll forget, you know, like.

that have to get done. So I manage that too, just making sure like everything gets ⁓ done on the job rather than just giving a client here's plans, good luck, go find somebody to do the work or here's materials, go find somebody to put it in. I help with all that. Just the project management portion. So that's where, you know, like with base camp,

I've used it for my project management. ⁓ But I think with with how's it, it seems like they're trying to replace some of that with what they offer ⁓ with also with house. They have

templates and I haven't really gone through and looked into all of it yet, but I was like, well, essentially I could put together a template. Like I think I showed you Thomas, my spreadsheet where I had ⁓ the materials for like if I'm walking through a bathroom and I can do like faucets, tub, shower, you know, base, vanity, I could just check off all the things that I need and like, here's what I'm going to do.

Speaker 2 (35:13)
Okay. In total, how much does this cost in you per month? All of these softwares combined. Do you have that off the top of your head?

Speaker 1 (35:23)
Well, right now since my grandfather didn't know this other system.

I have probably $100 to $150 a month.

Speaker 2 (35:36)
Yeah, that's not too bad. But you're going to get this right very soon.

Speaker 1 (35:41)
No.

Speaker 2 (35:42)
No, so yeah, I think the automations would be the one we I think we've learned a lot about your workflow and I think that's actually where we can help you not the software, but because you've got that and your problem is the time between all them and the manual processes. But we can go in there into all those individual softwares and automate things and connect them together. It's actually fairly simple, much easier than designing one from scratch or recreating these from scratch and then joining them together.

There's a lot of features that I don't think because 150 bucks you're talking if we're developing this it'll be 2,000 bucks per month Do you know what mean from scratch? So yeah, so I think the automations would be far better for you. It would actually make sense ⁓

Speaker 1 (36:28)
So then from, okay, so then with, like once my system.

whenever it jumps up to the house, whenever it jumps up to what they're going to charge, because right now I'm grandfathered in, then it's going to go to about 400, it adds about $300. So I'll be about 400 to $450 a month, which that I can't do with me and my husband being, you know, this is

we're both working this job together, you know. that's where it's like, well, that's gonna be quite a big jump from where it's at now. And then my other question, so yeah, so it's still far less than 2,000 a month, which is great, but there's also a lot of things I feel like that's like right now my reports isn't working or.

What if I change my system? What if I go into the material one or this one here that I'm showing you now rather than the house? Is this a matter of un-linking and linking up a new system?

Speaker 2 (37:42)
Yeah, yeah, essentially. yeah, exactly. So I think that would be the better one. But like, it's more of a long term play if you're designing your own. If you're going to do this for the next five years, 10 years, for sure, having your own system where you can customize it and have basically all of this because you are doing three jobs in one go.

Essentially, right. So that's why there's so many softwares here. But yeah, absolutely. It would be a long term investment. So if you're actually up for that, yes. But short term, it will cost you and more in the short term across the six months or across a year for sure. No doubt about it. But for the automations, it's a simple, you know, fixing those tax problems or fixing those financial problems, those reports and then connecting all those systems together. I think.

be more feasible for now. ⁓ But if you want to do the latter it's entirely up to you. But it's not going to be 500.

Speaker 1 (38:43)
for me

to create my own and use a platform that it's going to be $2,000 a month.

Speaker 2 (38:51)
Yeah, like to develop it. Yeah.

Speaker 3 (38:55)
Are you talking about financing the initial build fee or?

Speaker 2 (39:01)
Yeah, so that's the build, it's not the subscription, no. To maintain it, it won't be that much. It would probably be less than 100 per month, depending on how much data you use and how much data we have to store. No, so it's just the build, initial build. That's why I'm saying long term, it would be easy, right? It would be an easy bet, but short term, it might affect you a little bit more.

Speaker 3 (39:27)
Right. Yeah. ⁓ a lot of that is going to be based on how often all of your automations are being used. So if you do have a high automation rate, that's going to affect how many tokens you need to get on a monthly basis. And all of the automation platforms have different pricing packages based on your usage. And so that's where our monthly fee kind of comes in. We'll have our monthly maintenance fee of, you know, a few dollars just to keep it hosted and everything with the

platform, but then mainly beyond that you're paying for the actual automation usage, which is where most of our fees

Speaker 2 (40:03)
comes

from.

Speaker 3 (40:06)
Yeah,

and data storage. And then I believe in the initial project proposal, we had said the build fee was about $5,500. And then where he got the $2,000 a month was probably financing that over the initial build fee as we're progressing through the project. I did mention in there that

The project could take or the software could take, you know, upwards of eight to 12 weeks to fully build and flush out for you. ⁓ So if we were to do ⁓

you know, every four weeks as we're making progress, we can do progressive payments towards the completion of it. Or I didn't know how your end of year was looking. But if you just wanted to, for tax reasons, if you wanted to just pay for it before or after the end of the year in a lump sum, we can do that as well. But beyond that, the subscription, like you said, isn't 2000 a month, it would definitely be.

you know, right on par or underneath the 450 that you're going to be getting from house. And we're cutting.

Speaker 2 (41:16)
long term it would cost less. Over the short term it's going to obviously be costing more than 500 and it's actually based off this what I've been shown today because I don't know Thomas did did Angie go through all this as well with you? ⁓

Speaker 3 (41:33)
We sat and talked

for like three hours or something the first time we met.

Speaker 2 (41:38)
And C and Arnis CTO said that's.

Speaker 3 (41:42)
I think he said there may be a few API problems with how specifically they're not very open with it, but ⁓ He did say that we could get a lot of this

Speaker 2 (41:54)
Okay, cool.

Speaker 1 (41:57)
Okay. So would it be first to like if you had it all on one platform like what you had mentioned, that'd be like

the simplest solution, guess you'd say, having it all on one platform without doing the build out. That would be one option versus doing the build out.
