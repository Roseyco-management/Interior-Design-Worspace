# Agent B Prompt: Automation Flowcharts

## Your Mission

You are creating **visual flowcharts** that demonstrate automation workflows using n8n/Zapier with the client's existing tools.

## Context

Read these files first:
1. `/Path-B-Automation/PRD-automation-flowchart.md` - Complete requirements
2. `/meeting-transcript.md` - Client meeting context (optional)

## What to Build

**6 flowchart diagrams** showing:
1. Lead to Project Automation
2. Contractor Task Notification
3. Weekly Digest Automation
4. Invoice Reminder Automation
5. Tax Rate Lookup Tool
6. System Architecture Overview

Plus:
- Comparison visual (automated vs manual)
- Cost summary visual

## Output Options

Choose ONE approach:

### Option A: Image Files (Recommended for Quick)
Use a tool like:
- Figma
- Whimsical
- draw.io (diagrams.net)
- Lucidchart

Export as PNG/SVG to `/Path-B-Automation/diagrams/`

### Option B: Interactive Web Page
Build a simple Next.js page with React Flow or similar:
- Located in `/Path-B-Automation/demo/`
- Animated flow visualization
- Clickable nodes with descriptions

### Option C: Mermaid Diagrams
Create markdown files with Mermaid syntax:
- Can be rendered by GitHub, VS Code, etc.
- Located in `/Path-B-Automation/diagrams/`

## Key Messages to Convey

1. **Houzz Pro CANNOT be automated** - show this clearly
2. What CAN be automated (HoneyBook, Basecamp, etc.)
3. This path is cheaper but LIMITED
4. Many pain points remain unsolved

## Visual Style

- Color coding:
  - Blue: Software systems
  - Green: Automated actions
  - Yellow/Orange: Manual steps required
  - Red: Cannot be automated
- Clean, professional appearance
- Clear flow direction (top to bottom or left to right)

## Priority Order

If time limited:
1. System Architecture Overview (most important)
2. Lead to Project workflow
3. Comparison visual (automated vs manual)
4. Cost summary

## Success Criteria

- Clear visualization of what automation can/cannot do
- Honest about limitations
- Professional appearance
- Can be presented in a sales meeting
